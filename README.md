## Hi there, I'm Tatum 👋

📚 I’m a Computer Science major with an AI/ML concentration at Duke University, minoring in English. I’m passionate about using technology for social good and especially interested in how machine learning can deliver personalized, meaningful impact.

👩‍💻 Currently interning at Manhattan Associates for the summer, where I’m building a generative AI tool that enables non-developers to create behavior-driven test cases by generating customized Cucumber feature files. My work involves LLM customization, component and end-to-end testing, and agile development to improve the accessibility and efficiency of enterprise software testing.
