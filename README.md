## Hi there, I'm Tatum 👋

📚 I’m a Computer Science major with an AI/ML concentration at Duke University, minoring in English. I’m passionate about using technology for social good and especially interested in how machine learning can deliver personalized, meaningful impact.

👩‍💻 I recently completed a Software Engineering Internship at Manhattan Associates, where I trained and fine-tuned an LLM to generate Java code and BDD test cases in a proprietary testing language, cutting authoring time by over 80%. I also built a React/Spring Boot tool for no-code test creation and validation, and optimized WMOS shipment allocation service by refactoring multi-threaded job scheduling, improving execution speed by 22% in high-volume simulations.
